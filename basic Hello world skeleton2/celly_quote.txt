Now, I fully recognize that such a shift in mindset is not easy--if it were, everyone would have done so by now! However, what I would like to assure you of, dear reader, is that it is possible. No matter how bleak things seem, no matter how difficult life gets, it can--and oftentimes does--get better! There is another philosopher in your world who once said that "Time crumbles things. Everything grows old and is forgotten under the power of time." This is no less true for your struggles, difficulties, and hardships than it is for anything else!

You matter. You have worth. You are important--and you should never be someone you neglect in your journey.
